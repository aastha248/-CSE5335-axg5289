# Questions
**A) What server framework did you choose and why?**<br>

Ruby on Rails is chosen as the server framework for this project. Reasons:<br>
1) Ruby is an object-oriented, easily readable language<br>
2) Rails is designed with two guiding principle
* DRY i.e. "Don't Repeat Yourself"
* Convention over Configuration i.e. Sensible defaults, only specify uncoventional aspects
3) rails supports agile programming

I have choosen angularjs as the client framework because of the following reasons:
	
1) Excellent Templating engine
2) Handles DOM masterfully
